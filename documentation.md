Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The first line of the code imports the **`React`**, **`useState`**, and **`useEffect`** hooks from the **`react`** package and the **`bg`** image from the **`./assets/sunset.jpg`** file.
2. The **`App()`** function is defined. This is a functional component in React that returns the UI of the weather app.
3. The component has four state variables defined using the **`useState`** hook. These state variables are:
    - **`location`**: a string that stores the name of the location that the user inputs.
    - **`data`**: an object that stores the weather data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.
    - **`loading`**: a boolean value that indicates whether the app is currently loading data from the API.
    - **`error`**: an object that stores any error that occurs during the API call.
4. The **`api_key`** variable is defined to store the API key that is used to make API requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
5. The **`useEffect`** hook is used to make an API call to OpenWeatherMap API when the **`location`** or **`api_key`** state variables change. The function passed to the **`useEffect`** hook makes an async call to fetch weather data from the API. If the **`location`** state is empty, the **`data`** state variable is set to null. If the **`location`** state is not empty, the **`loading`** state is set to true and the **`error`** state is set to null. Then, the weather data is fetched from the API using a **`fetch`** request, and the response is converted to JSON format using the **`json`** method. The resulting data is stored in the **`data`** state variable, and the **`loading`** state is set to false. If an error occurs during the API call, the error message is stored in the **`error`** state variable.
6. The **`handleLocationChange`** function is defined to handle the change in the **`location`** state when the user inputs a location in the input field.
7. The **`render`** method returns the UI of the weather app. The UI consists of a **`div`** container with a background image, a **`h1`** title, an input field to enter the location, and a **`div`** container to display the weather data.
8. The input field has an **`onChange`** event handler that calls the **`handleLocationChange`** function and updates the **`location`** state.
9. Conditional rendering is used to display a "Loading..." message while the **`loading`** state is true, an error message if the **`error`** state is not null, and the weather data if the **`data`** state is not null and contains the necessary fields.
10. Finally, the **`App`** component is exported as the default export of the module. This allows the component to be used in other parts of the application.
